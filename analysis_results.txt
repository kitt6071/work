--- Analysis Complete ---
Consider the generated PNG files for visualizations.
The 'shape of things' (distributions, network properties) indeed matters and is reflected in these analyses.
For example, skewed distributions in threats per species or IUCN category prevalence highlight common vs. rare issues.
Network perspectives (like species connected to many IUCN types, or IUCN types connected to many species) identify critical nodes/categories.
